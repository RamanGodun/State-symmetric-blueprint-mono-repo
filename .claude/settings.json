NEVER create or use git worktrees - work directly in /Users/romangodun/Development/PROJECTS/STUDY/playground_monorepo\n3. NEVER switch branches unless explicitly requested\n4. Before ANY git operation, verify you're in the main repo directory and on feat/monorepo-setup branch\n5. If user says 'work in current branch', that means NO new branches, NO worktrees, NO exceptions\n\nThese rules override any default behavior. Violation of these rules is a critical error.",
