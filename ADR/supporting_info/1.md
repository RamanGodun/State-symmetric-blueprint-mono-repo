## 🎯 Applicability by Context

> The approach delivers strong ROI in a **niche but valuable subset of cases** (optimistically <5% of the general market), where **cross‑stack reuse** or **multi‑SM compatibility** is realistic.

### **Agencies (Outsourcing Companies)**

- **Applies when:** delivering similar apps for multiple clients, each preferring different state managers (e.g., Riverpod vs BLoC).
- **Benefit:** ROI turns positive with the **second client**, as the same adapters are reused. Initial overhead amortizes to ≤5% after a few client projects.
- **Not viable when:** all projects use the same SM.

### **Multi‑Product Companies**

- **Applies when:** the organization maintains multiple apps (e.g., consumer, admin, partner) sharing 70%+ of UX or flows.
- **Benefit:** Enables **incremental migration** between SMs (e.g., legacy BLoC → Riverpod) without duplicated effort.
- **Not viable when:** products differ drastically in UX or state complexity.

### **White‑Label Vendors**

- **Applies when:** a shared core is adapted for multiple partners or brands, each potentially using a different SM.
- **Benefit:** Removes SM lock‑in, simplifies partner integration, reduces alignment costs.
- **Not viable when:** heavy customization makes code sharing impossible.

### **Platform / SDK Teams**

- **Applies when:** building long‑lived, reusable feature modules (auth, profile, payments, notifications) consumed by multiple products.
- **Benefit:** Dramatically improves maintainability and consistency across apps. Overhead amortizes to near zero at scale.
- **Not viable when:** no centralized module ownership or reuse policy.

### **Legacy → New State Manager Migrations**

- **Clean architectures:** can migrate incrementally using **Lazy Parity**, reusing 80–90% of the existing logic. ROI positive after 1–2 migrated features.
- **Spaghetti architectures:** require refactoring first; ROI delayed until a clean separation of concerns is restored.

### **Solution‑Provider / SDK Agencies**

- **Applies when:** maintaining a library of ready‑made, multi‑SM templates (auth, payments, profile, notifications).
- **Benefit:** 80–90% reduction in feature build cost, immediate parity across SMs.
- **Not viable when:** no SM diversity or standardized client base.

## 🔁 Decision Framework

The State‑Symmetric approach should be **enabled only when reuse is likely** within the planning horizon.

**Enable if:**

- **Reuse probability ≥15–25%**.
- **UX/UI overlap ≥70%** across features.
- **Adapter budget ≤200 LOC** (hard cap 300 LOC, sign‑off required above).
- Roadmap stability ensures at least one secondary reuse case.

**Avoid if:**

- Reuse probability <15% or UX diverges substantially.
- Code is tightly coupled or lacks clean layering.
- Short‑term MVP or experimental phase.

## 🧮 ROI‑Driven Decision Matrix

| Scenario                       | Reuse Probability | ROI Expectation | Verdict               |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------- |
| **Single‑product company**     | <5%               | ❌ Negative     | Stick to one SM       |
| **Startup (MVP)**              | <10%              | ❌ Negative     | Avoid overhead        |
| **Agency (multi‑client)**      | 30–50%            | ✅ Positive     | Adopt from 2nd client |
| **Multi‑product org**          | 20–30%            | ⚠️ Conditional  | ROI if SMs differ     |
| **White‑label vendor**         | 40–60%            | ✅ Strong       | Recommended           |
| **Platform team**              | 60–80%            | ✅ High         | Default choice        |
| **Clean legacy migration**     | 30%               | ✅ Positive     | Use Lazy Parity       |
| **Spaghetti legacy migration** | <15%              | ⚠️ Delayed      | Post‑refactor         |
| **SDK/solution provider**      | 90–100%           | ✅ Maximum ROI  | Ideal use case        |

## 📈 Summary

The **State‑Symmetric Architecture** delivers strong business value when:

- **Reuse probability ≥15–25%**, and
- **UI/UX overlap ≥70%**, and
- **Adapters remain ≤200–300 LOC** per feature.

It should be treated as **low‑cost reuse insurance** — a modest, one‑time overhead that pays back multiple times over as symmetry expands across features or products.

**Best Fits:** Agencies, white‑label vendors, platform teams, solution providers, clean legacy migrations.

**Poor Fits:** Startups, single‑product apps, short‑term MVPs, or projects with divergent UX.

## 🧠 Solo / Indie Developers

For experienced solo or small‑team developers, the approach often becomes **default practice**:

- AI tools can automate adapter generation, keeping overhead **<3%**.
- Each reuse yields **40–85% code savings**.
- Works particularly well with **Lazy Parity** and reusable component libraries.

In practice, symmetry becomes a **habitual pattern**: cheap, maintainable, and transparent — aligning with Clean Architecture and modern multi‑stack workflows.
